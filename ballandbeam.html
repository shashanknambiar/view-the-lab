            <p>This project implements a Ball and Beam control system to study the end-to-end development of a PID
                controller, from mathematical modeling and simulation to real-time embedded implementation. The
                objective was to analyze controller behavior, limitations of physical systems, and discrepancies between
                ideal models and real-world execution.</p>

                        <p>The system dynamics were derived using the Lagrangian formulation, following established
                            ball-and-beam models. Simulations were performed using GNU Octave to analyze system response
                            and to obtain initial controller gains.

                            The simulated model was used to determine values of Kp and Kd that satisfied the design
                            objectives under ideal conditions.</p>
                        <p>
                            The following values were obtained for Kp and Kd with the following simulation results.

                        <p class="text-2xl font-bold underline underline-offset-6 mt-2 mb-2">Controller Architecture</p>
                        <p>A classical PID controller was implemented in discrete time on the Arduino Mega. The control
                            loop operated in real time, incorporating sensor feedback and servo actuation.</p>

                        <p class="text-2xl font-bold underline underline-offset-6 mt-2 mb-2">Observation</p>
                        <p>Simulation-derived gains were deployed on the physical system and refined through iterative
                            tuning. Performance deviations from simulation were observed due to:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Extremely low ball inertia, leading to high sensitivity</li>
                            <li>Measurement noise from the ultrasonic sensor</li>
                            <li>Mechanical dead zone and backlash in the servo motor</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Despite these non-idealities, stable control around the desired setpoint was achieved.</p>

                        <p>This project strengthened practical understanding of feedback control and emphasized the gap
                            between theoretical models and real-world systems. It highlighted the importance of sensor
                            quality, actuator characteristics, and iterative tuning in embedded control applications.

                        <p class="text-2xl font-bold underline underline-offset-6 mt-2 mb-2">Further Work</p>
                        <p>Future work will focus on improving sensing and state estimation to address measurement noise
                            and unmodeled dynamics observed in the current system. This includes implementing
                            observer-based approaches such as a Kalman filter or velocity observer, as well as
                            performing system identification to obtain more accurate model parameters.

                            Additional work includes compensating for actuator nonlinearities such as dead zones and
                            saturation, and extending the control framework to multivariable systems with coupled
                            dynamics, such as a Stewart platform. Improvements in sensing using camera-based position
                            measurement would further enable higher control bandwidth and more systematic tuning and
                            control design methodologies.</p>
